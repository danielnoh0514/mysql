Normalization prevents duplicate information
You need to apply three normal forms

First normal form - each cell should have a single value and we cannot have repeated columns 
 adding many to many relationship between tables
 use length table

Second normal form - every table should describe one entity, and every column in that
table should describe that entity.
Ex. courses table has 3 coumns -> course id, title and price. every column describes course
 
 
 Third normal form - a column should not be derived from other columns
 EX. first_name, last_name, full_name
 delete full_name
